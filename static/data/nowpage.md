### Life Stuff !

Graduated about 2 months ago (May 2025), I've been mostly resting and working on smaller projects and grad school applications since. Hopefully I get accepted and can start towards a PhD this spring semester (January 2026).

### Working on

Since graduating I've spent some more time on my Minecraft mods as well. I spent a couple days on a small mod called Potion Icons and finished up Month of Swords the other week (more like,, 9 months of swords). 

Most recently I've spent the past few days cleaning up my website, adding proper write-ups for various projects, making it more responsive, refreshing some of the styling, switching the generator to run asynchronously so that it can fetch remote data (check out those sick embeds below!), and making this now page!

#### Clothes

I've been trying to expand my wardrobe recently. For a while now I've worn mostly black skirts and shirts but lately I've been feeling more earth tones (I suppose actually the shift started about a year ago, summer 2024ish, but it's accelerated recently). I've gotten a few new dresses so there's slightly more shape options too. I still need some more shirts though. I think button ups or blousier shirts in cream/offwhite or brown would be cute. I also recently got some jewelry from my granny after she passed that I've been enjoying wearing. And it's nice to have little reminders of her with me.

My converse wore out after about a year and a half, the inner and outer soles both got holes in them! I got a pair of [Solovair Brown Boots](https://us.nps-solovair.com/collections/brown/products/s8-551-ch-g) that I'm hoping will last longer so I don't have to deal with replacing shoes so often. 

### Media I'm Enjoying :>

#### Playing

My partner got me back into Animal Crossing. My island was a mess and my villagers said they hadn't seen me in 3 years! I think the island design options can be a little overwhelming. We've been playing carcassonne together too. I've also been playing the DS version by myself, it has a weird storymode for some reason?

#### Reading

DC Bombshells, Batwoman Elegy, & DC Pride 2025. It seems I've gotten back into comics. I was really into them as a teenager but fell out of it for whatever reason.
I've been working my way through the [DC Pride collection](https://www.dcuniverseinfinite.com/collections/edt-dcuniverse-pride) and quite enjoying it!
