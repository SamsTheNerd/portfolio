Month of Swords is a Minecraft mod that adds 30 swords with unique themes and abilities. It was originally created for [Swordtember 2024](https://www.instagram.com/faith_schaffer/p/C-omLVXxjdm/) with the goal of getting faster with developing mod features by drawing and implementing one sword each day. That was going well until about halfway through the month when I got busy with school and life and fell behind a few swords. After that I slowed down and spent more time on some sword features and I'm quite happy with how they came out!

The [modrinth page](https://modrinth.com/mod/monthofswords/gallery) has some images of swords in action and descriptions of all of their abilities, but the best way to learn is just to play!
