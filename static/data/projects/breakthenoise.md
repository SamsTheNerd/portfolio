This was made for {{ {code:"COMM-2660", name:"Introduction To Graphic Design "} | quatalink }} in October-ish 2022. The assignment was to make a poster for a fictional music event, so I based mine on urlfests (online music shows popularized in 2020) and noisy, experimental-ish, electronic-ish music (see below for what I was listening to at the time!)

This was made with Illustrator and lots of compound shape clipping (I set up a key shortcut macro to intersect two shapes!). It was also some of my earlier work with exploring texture, which would come up over and over again in my later work. This is still some of my favorite texture work, I love the blocky font and big shapes giving room for larger sections of color, and how the words stand out with color but blend in with texture.

## Music

Here's some music I was listening to at the time that inspired this:

- Drive-By Lullabies by Quinn.
- Lots of Recovery Girl, especially NAUSEA POP, Recovery Girl & Friends, and Grit Ur Teeth. I think I played a bit of one of the NAUSEA POPs as a style reference for the class, but I don't remember which one specifically.
- Jedwill, I had those 2022 singles on loop! Icarus was my 2nd most played song of 2022
- Gupi, especially 1P-747 Chopped, which was my most played song. Also Master Builder 1999
- 100 Gecs, I think I was listening to tree of clues a lot around then?
