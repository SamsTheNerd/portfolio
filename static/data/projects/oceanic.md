This is a series of prints I did for {{ {code:"ARTS-2090", name:" Radical Graphics/Screenprint"} | quatalink }} in Spring 2024. The assignment was to make an expressive print using screen filler or some other hand-made element. The piece is supposed to feel somewhere between floating and sinking.

{{ 
    [
        {src: "screenprinting/oceanic/oceanic.jpeg"}
    ] | mkGallery({classes:["tall"]})
}}

I did the initial base of the design digitally in photoshop. I used screen filler and a brush for additional texture.
