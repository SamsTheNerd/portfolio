I ran a series of Minecraft modding workshops on campus during Summer 2024 going over the basics of modding. We went over how to set up a modding environment with gradle, what all the given files are for, and then how to add basic blocks and items. 

The workshop was primarily meant for students taking {{ {code:"CSCI-2600", name:"Principles Of Software"} | quatalink }} or {{ {code:"CSCI-4963", name:"Application Design Using Java"} | quatalink }} (two classes which I happened to be mentoring at the time!), but was open to all of course.

The [repo](https://github.com/SamsTheNerd/rpimod/) has a lot of my notes documented in readmes in the directories and comments in the files, but a lot of the presentation was just verbal.
