While mentoring for {{{code:"CSCI-4963", name:"Application Design Using Java"} | quatalink }} we had a day where the undergrad course staff did the lecture on topics we were interested in. I spent my half of the lecture covering Java build tools like Maven and Gradle. 

The lecture slides should be embedded below, or can be [downloaded here](https://samsthenerd.com/assets/javabuildtoolslecture.pdf).
