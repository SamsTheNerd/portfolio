This [Minecraft mod](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minecraft_modding) is a library for creating radial menus. The name stands for "Why Not Be One Item" since it was meant to be used for condensing the functionality of multiple items into a single item.

Since Minecraft has relatively light built-in rendering capabilities, a decent chunk of this project was spent figuring out how to draw circles and shapes with outlines using just Minecraft's basic vertex rendering modes.
