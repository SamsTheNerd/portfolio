This is a series of prints I did for {{ {code:"ARTS-2090", name:" Radical Graphics/Screenprint"} | quatalink }} in Spring 2024. The assignment was to make a design, put it on a screen, and then make prints using screens from everyone in the class. We were encouraged to use and modify found/pop-culture designs. My chosen design was garfield with a bit of added texture, distortion, and various references.

I did the initial base of the design digitally in photoshop. I think the two geometric designs were from the same person's screen, and I just covered part of it each time. The small cats were a part of a larger design, that might've had more cats? maybe coffee? I covered everything except the cats. The green bits were reused from around garfield. Here are some process photos:
