This was made as an assignment for {{ {code:"COMM-2570", name:"Typography"} | quatalink}}. We were given a list of phrases to pick from to use in a poster alongside photography. 

The piece is meant to feel lonely and a little chaotic. The text is repeated as the background to mimic ruminating thoughts and create visual texture. The base image is heavily distorted and glitched to create a sense of instability. The empty bench is highlighted and contrasted from the background to add to the sense of loneliness.
