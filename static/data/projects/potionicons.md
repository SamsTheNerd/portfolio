Potion Icons is a small minecraft mod that puts effect icons in more places, primarily overlaid over potion items and in text. It depends on [Inline](https://samsthenerd.com/projects/inline/) for a lot of the rendering hooks it uses. All of its features are configurable in-game so players can choose how they want to use the mod. 

The [Modrinth page](https://modrinth.com/mod/potionicons) has photos of the mod in-game.
