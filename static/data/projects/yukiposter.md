This is a series of prints I did for {{ {code:"ARTS-2090", name:" Radical Graphics/Screenprint"} | quatalink }} in Spring 2024. The assignment was to make a music or protest poster using at least two screens/colors. I chose to make mine based on my friend's music, which you can find under Yuki Unknown linked below!

{{

        {src: "screenprinting/yuki/yukiunknown.jpeg"}
    ] | mkGallery({classes:["tall"]})
}}

I did the initial design digitally in photoshop. Here are some progress photos:
