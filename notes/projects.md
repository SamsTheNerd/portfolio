- Project 4/5 (Logos/Letterhead) -- *maybe*, i didn't love those ones
- Project 6 (Deconstruction video)

### Typography
- Exercise 1-3 -- might want to just pick the best out of these, but i did like most of them. Will need to re-export as png though 
- Project 1 (self portrait) - this one toes the line of what do i want employers to see. Also i don't consider it my very best work
- Project 2 (Bench) - it's kinda personal but yeah i want to include it, it's good work
- Project 3 (Protest Poster) - I mean,, again, how much do i want to show employers
- Project 4 (Magazine) - maybe? same as 1&3 + also I didn't super love that piece
